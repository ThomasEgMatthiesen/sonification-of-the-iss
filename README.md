# Sonification of the ISS
Using real-time data on the ISS's position, this Max/MSP patch calculates the user's distance from the space station, which in turn influences sound synthesis, modulation and effects. The patch audibly monitors the distance between a location on a map and the International Space Station, using sonification, the process of conveying information through sound without speech. [See a demonstration of the patch in use here.](https://www.thomaseg.dk/)
